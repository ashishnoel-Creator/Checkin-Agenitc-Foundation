# Branding Guidelines

> Last updated: Feb 16, 2026

## Brand Identity

- **Name:** CheckIn (capital C, capital I — always)
- **Tagline (Primary):** "The Operating System for the Experience Economy"
- **Tagline (F&B-specific):** "The F&B Experience, Reimagined"
- **Sub-tagline:** "Gamified Loyalty, Vibrant Communities, Real Venue Growth"

**Naming decision (Feb 16, 2026):** Canonical spelling is "CheckIn" (capital C, capital I). Not "Checkin", "Check-In", or "CHECKIN". All documents standardized.

## Visual Direction

From pitch deck guidelines:

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary Background | #F8F5F2 (warm beige) |
| Primary Text | #333333 (dark gray) |
| Headings/Accents | #5C3A21 (warm brown) |
| Primary Accent | #E2725B (terracotta/coral) |
| White | #FFFFFF |
| Secondary Accent/Borders | #E2DACC (light beige) |

**Tone:** Confident, modern, forward-thinking, grounded in data and user insights. Avoids hype; focuses on tangible outcomes.

## Brand Voice

### For Venues (B2B)
- **Tone:** Empowering, direct, ROI-focused
- **Style:** "We give you back control" — partner language, not salesperson language
- **Avoid:** Jargon, hype, promises without data
- **Example:** "Own your customer relationships. Track engagement with real data. Grow with tools that work for you, not against you."

### For Users (B2C)
- **Tone:** Fun, social, rewarding — like a friend who knows the best spots
- **Style:** Casual, energetic, FOMO-inducing for quests and leaderboards
- **Avoid:** Corporate language, overly technical explanations
- **Example:** "Your favorite spots, one app. Earn credits, complete quests, flex on leaderboards."

### For Investors
- **Tone:** Strategic, data-driven, ambitious but grounded
- **Style:** Infrastructure and platform language — "engagement OS", "agentic revenue", "data sovereignty"
- **Avoid:** Consumer-style hype, unsubstantiated claims, overusing "disrupt"
- **Example:** "We're building the engagement infrastructure for physical-world brands. SaaS + agentic revenue model, not food commissions."
