# Branding Guidelines

> Last synthesized: Feb 15, 2026

## Brand Identity

- **Name:** CheckIn (also styled as "Checkin" in some contexts — standardize to "CheckIn")
- **Tagline (Primary):** "The Operating System for the Experience Economy"
- **Tagline (F&B-specific):** "The F&B Experience, Reimagined"
- **Sub-tagline:** "Gamified Loyalty, Vibrant Communities, Real Venue Growth"

## Visual Direction

From pitch deck guidelines:

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary Background | #F8F5F2 (warm beige) |
| Primary Text | #333333 (dark gray) |
| Headings/Accents | #5C3A21 (warm brown) |
| Primary Accent | #E2725B (terracotta/coral) |
| White | #FFFFFF |
| Secondary Accent/Borders | #E2DACC (light beige) |

**Tone:** Confident, modern, forward-thinking, grounded in data and user insights. Avoids hype; focuses on tangible outcomes.

## Brand Voice

[TODO: Define brand voice guidelines — how we write, how we speak to venues vs. users vs. investors]

## Logo & Assets

[TODO: Logo files, usage guidelines, social media templates]

[NEEDS REVIEW] Name standardization needed — "CheckIn" vs. "Checkin" used inconsistently across docs.
