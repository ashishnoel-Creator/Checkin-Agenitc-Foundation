## The Problem with Current Influencer Marketing

From customer discovery insights:
- Venues spend on influencers but have **zero attribution** — can't track if campaigns drove actual visits
- Most venues have tried influencer marketing but couldn't measure ROI
- Attribution is the "missing piece" — with guaranteed tracking, venues would invest more

## CheckIn's Promoter Engine (V2.0+)

A dedicated "Proof of Influence" platform:
- Venues add promoters (DJs, influencers, event organizers) for specific events
- Promoter gets unique invite code/deep link
- System tracks entire customer cohort lifecycle (footfall, spend, retention) attributed to promoter
- Promoters get verified KPIs as trusted "resume" for fee negotiations

## Pre-Platform Influencer Strategy

[TODO: Develop strategy for pre-product influencer campaigns as part of GTM services bundle]

## Influencer Outreach Template

[TODO: Create outreach templates for different influencer tiers]
