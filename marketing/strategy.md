# Marketing Strategy

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## GTM Overview

**Beachhead:** F&B in Bengaluru — Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR Layout clusters

### Venue Acquisition
- **RM-led high-touch onboarding** for first 50–75 partners
- Freemium model lowers entry barrier
- Clear ROI messaging vs. aggregators: data ownership, modern engagement, reduced dependency
- Co-marketing support for early adopters
- Target: Independent + small-chain cafes, pubs, casual dining in premium Gen-Z clusters

### User Acquisition
- **Primary:** In-venue QR code scanning (venue-powered, zero paid acquisition)
- **Auto-follow mechanic:** Checking in at a venue = auto-follow. The diner joins that venue's community. Venue can reach them via notifications and feed. Diner can unfollow anytime. No Zomato-style consent popups — the physical act of visiting IS the consent. This is the core data ownership mechanism.
- **Product-led virality:** Group quests, bill splitting, leaderboard sharing inherently social
- **Organic:** Food blogger collaborations, localized digital campaigns in launch neighborhoods
- **Key insight:** Gen-Z trusts friends 50% more than influencers → social mechanics > paid ads
- **Gated app download:** Browser check-in is the hook. Premium features (leaderboards, collectibles, feed) gated behind app download. Target: >20% of browser users convert to app.

### Scaling Playbook
- Phase 1: High-touch RM model (hand-hold first venues)
- Phase 2: More automated self-service portal as patterns are proven

## Pre-Product GTM Bundle

**Pricing hypothesis:** ₹15–30K expected, ₹8–15K "no-brainer" price point
