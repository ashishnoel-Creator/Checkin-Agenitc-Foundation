# Pitch Deck Outline — Investor Presentation

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## Deck Structure (12 Slides)

### Slide 1: Title
- **Headline:** CheckIn
- **Tagline:** "The Operating System for the Experience Economy" (primary) / "The F&B Experience, Reimagined" (alternative)
- **Sub-tagline:** "Setting the New Standard: Gamified Loyalty, Vibrant Communities, Real Venue Growth"
- **Tone:** Confident, premium, foundational — frames CheckIn as a platform, not a feature

### Slide 2: The Problem — "The Experience Gap"
**Headline:** "The F&B Engagement Black Hole: Venues are Losing Control, Customers & Cash"

Three broken silos:
1. **Aggregator Stranglehold:** 15–28% delivery commissions + Dine-in programs (Zomato Pay/Swiggy Dineout) requiring 15–40% mandatory discounts + 4–12% commission — even on walk-in customers. Venues get aggregate dashboards but no individual customer identity (masked phone numbers, no per-diner profiles).
2. **The Loyalty Void:** >50% memberships inactive, boring transactional points, market lacks social gamification
3. **Fragmentation:** Users engage with only 10–15 apps daily; white-label solutions force separate app per brand; 3–5 disconnected tools per venue

**Key stat:** Gen-Z trusts friend recommendations 50% more than influencers — yet no platform leverages peer-to-peer social proof.

### Slide 3: The Solution — "Plugging the Leaks"
**Headline:** "CheckIn: The Unified Platform for F&B Engagement, Loyalty & Community"

Four pillars:
1. **From Transaction to Connection** — Venues own customer relationships and data
2. **From Friction to Fluidity** — One unified platform for all favorite spots
3. **From Points to Play** — Fun, social, gamified experiences
4. **From Silos to System** — Open, extensible platform (not closed app)

CheckIn is a platform ("Powered by CheckIn") where each venue gets a deep, customizable presence — their own page, quests, brand identity. When a diner scans a QR, they enter the venue's world within CheckIn. When they leave, they're on the broader CheckIn platform — browsing other venues, discovery, feed.

Dual value proposition: For Venues (own data, auto-follow community, gamified tools, per-venue AI agent) + For Users (unified platform, group quests, instant rewards, cross-venue discovery)

### Slide 4: Product — "The CheckIn Architecture"
**Headline:** "The CheckIn Ecosystem: Where Venues Thrive & Customers Love to Engage"

Three-tiered stack:
- **Foundation:** Core OS, Value Engine, Quest Engine, Community Graph
- **Application Layer:** Consumer App, Venue Dashboard, Plugin Marketplace
- **Intelligence Layer:** Synapse Engine (AI-powered insights)
- **Cross-cutting:** Identity & Trust Fabric

Show two flywheels: Customer Engagement Loop (Scan → Earn → Utilize → Connect) and Venue Growth Loop (Create → Engage → Track → Retain)

### Slide 5: Market Opportunity
**Headline:** "India's $80B+ F&B Market: A Revolution Driven by a New Generation"

| Metric | Size | Growth |
|--------|------|--------|
| Total F&B Market (India) | ~USD 80B (2024) | 10–11% CAGR |
| Organized Sector | ~USD 40B | 13.2% CAGR |
| Loyalty/Tech Solutions | USD 3.02B (2024) | 15.6% CAGR |
| Bengaluru Target Venues | ~2,500 premium | — |

**SOM projections (Bengaluru Premium Tier @ ₹2,000/month):**
- 10% penetration (250 venues): ₹0.6 Crore
- 30% penetration (750 venues): ₹1.8 Crore
- 50% penetration (1,250 venues): ₹3.0 Crore

### Slide 6: Customer Experience
**Headline:** "The Journey: Spark → Main Event → Afterglow"

Three-act narrative:
- **Pre-Visit (The Spark):** Social discovery, leaderboards, AI suggestions, city-wide quests
- **In-Venue (The Main Event):** QR scan, personalized AI menu, dynamic group quests, karaoke/DJ integration
- **Post-Visit (The Afterglow):** Instant credit redemption, bill splitting, badges, community status

### Slide 7: Venue Command Center
**Headline:** Three value pillars for venues

1. **Own Your Business Again:** 100% data ownership, break aggregator tax
2. **Engineer Your Branded Experience:** Quest Builder, community feed, Plugin Marketplace
3. **Cultivate & Understand Community:** Intelligence Layer, identify top regulars, actionable insights

### Slide 8: Live Demo
- Interactive prototype QR code scanning
- 2-minute video of Venue Dashboard (quest creation, leaderboard view, session analytics)

### Slide 9: Business Model
**Headline:** "SaaS + Agentic Revenue — Grows as AI Delivers More Value"

**Core Revenue:** Tiered SaaS subscriptions + agentic usage fees. Revenue correlates with value delivered — more AI engagement = more revenue = proof of value.
- Month 1: Base platform → ₹3,000/month
- Month 3: AI campaigns → ₹3,000 + ₹2,000 usage
- Month 6: Full autonomy + plugins → ₹3,000 + ₹4,000 + ₹1,500 plugins

**Payment Processing:** If CheckIn provides payment gateway services, per-transaction processing fee applies — infrastructure cost recovery, not a food commission.

**Phase 2 — Credit Economy Revenue (outcome-based, grows as economy circulates):**
- VC Circulation Fee: % cut per VC circulation cycle (~30-40% margin)
- GC Minting Fee: 15-20% retained from brand-funded campaigns (~90% margin)
- GC Redemption Spread: ₹0.85 reimbursement per ₹1 GC redeemed
- Breakage: expired/unredeemed credits = pure revenue (100% margin, no GST per CBIC Circular 243/37/2024)
- Swap Fees: % cut on GC→VC conversions
- **Unit economics: ₹45.60 CheckIn revenue per ₹100 brand spend**
- Intelligence Layer: premium analytics and AI insights
- Plugin marketplace revenue

### Slide 10: Go-To-Market & Traction
**Headline:** "Bengaluru: The Gen-Z Hotbed"

Strategy:
- Hyperlocal cluster play (Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR Layout)
- RM-led high-touch venue onboarding
- Product-led virality (group quests, bill splitting inherently social)

**12-Month milestones:**
- 150–200 venues in target clusters
- 25,000 MAU
- 50,000+ quest completions
- V1.5 features launched (Dual Wallet, Event Pilot)

### Slide 11: Roadmap — "From Prototype to Platform"

3-phase progression:
1. **Phase 1A: Prototype (Now):** Full vision demo — browser check-in, app, venue backend with WhatsApp AI agent, plugin showcase, money flows, diner AI agent. Shows investors everything that's possible.
2. **Phase 1B: MVP (First Deployment):** Focused slice to real venues — QR browser check-in, core quests, VCs, basic venue dashboard, campaign builder, gated app download. Clear metrics: quest completion >40%, return visit >35%, VC redemption >60%, QR conversion >50%.
3. **Phase 2: Intelligence & Expansion (Post-Seed):** App with discovery, per-venue AI agent on real data, GC launch, diner AI agent, plugin iteration.
4. **Phase 3: Platform & Network Effects:** Full autonomy, chains, brand marketplace, cross-city.

Future verticals: Retail, Wellness, Live Events

### Slide 12: Competitive Positioning — "Why We Win"

Updated competitive table with Dine-In Programs as separate category:

| Dimension | Aggregators | Dine-In Programs (Zomato Pay/Swiggy Dineout) | Loyalty Tools (Reelo) | CheckIn |
|-----------|------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Customer ownership | Aggregate dashboards, masked contacts | Aggregator mediates walk-in transactions | Basic CRM | Check-in = auto-follow, full diner profiles |
| Cost to venue | 15–28% commission | 15–40% discount + 4–12% commission | Flat SaaS | SaaS + agentic usage |
| Engagement | Discounts | Discount-driven | Points | Gamified quests, streaks |
| Intelligence | Platform-level, not shared | None for venue | Basic analytics | Per-venue AI agent |

### Slide 13: The Team
**Headline:** "The Team That Gets This Done"

**Ashish — CEO / Product / Builder / Technical Lead**
