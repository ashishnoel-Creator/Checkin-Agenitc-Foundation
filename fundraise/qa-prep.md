# Investor Q&A Preparation

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

[TODO: Develop comprehensive Q&A based on pitch deck and common investor concerns]

## Anticipated Questions

### Market & Competition
- **Q: How do you compete with Zomato/Swiggy?**
  A: We don't compete on delivery — we compete on dine-in experience where they're weakest. Their model is transactional; ours is emotional and gamified. We give venues data sovereignty they'll never get from aggregators.

- **Q: What stops Zomato from copying this?**
  A: Their DNA is delivery and discovery, not in-venue engagement. Gamified loyalty with group dynamics, community features, and venue-specific currencies is architecturally different from discount subscriptions. Also, venues are actively looking for alternatives to aggregator dependency — they won't trust the fox guarding the henhouse.

- **Q: How is this different from Reelo or other Indian loyalty SaaS?**
  A: Reelo is B2B-only with basic points/cashback. We offer a unified consumer platform with social gamification, group quests, credit pooling, and community features. No Indian SaaS combines venue empowerment with consumer engagement.

- **Q: Aren't you just another aggregator?**
  A: CheckIn does aggregate venues — the GC economy and cross-venue discovery require a network. But the model is fundamentally different from Zomato/Swiggy. The venue owns every customer relationship (check-in = auto-follow, venue gets full diner profiles). Revenue comes from SaaS tiers and agentic AI usage, not per-order commissions. If we provide payment gateway services, there's a per-transaction processing fee — but that's infrastructure cost recovery, not a food commission. Zomato sits between diner and venue on every transaction; CheckIn empowers the venue to build its own community.

- **Q: Don't aggregators already share data with venues?**
  A: They give venues aggregate dashboards — order volumes, AOV, ratings, operational metrics. But no individual customer identity: phone numbers are masked, no per-diner behavioral profiles. Even Zomato's late-2025 data-sharing initiative only shares phone numbers with customer opt-in — and a phone number without context is just spam fuel, not a customer relationship. CheckIn gives venues full profiles of every diner who's checked in: visit patterns, taste preferences, spending behavior, social connections.

### Business Model
- **Q: Why will venues pay for another tool?**
  A: Venues already spend ₹30K–1L/month on marketing with zero attribution. We offer measurable ROI at ₹2K/month — a fraction of what they waste on untracked Instagram and aggregator spend.

- **Q: What's your path to profitability?**
  A: [TODO: Link to financial model]

### Product
- **Q: How do you solve the cold-start problem?**
  A: Partner Coins function as standalone B2B loyalty tools even before the network forms. Venues get value from day one. Hyperlocal cluster strategy in 3 neighborhoods creates local density fast.

- **Q: What about the credit system regulatory risk?**
  A: VCs structured as closed-loop loyalty points (exempt from VDA tax). GCs designed with usage caps and governance utility. Full compliance framework with offshore expansion path. See `operations/compliance.md`.

### Team
- **Q: Why this team?**
  A: [TODO: Develop team narrative — Ashish's gaming/venue/startup background, Aravind's compliance expertise, Shash's growth experience]

### Traction
- **Q: What traction do you have?**
  A: [TODO: Update with current traction — customer discovery results, venue commitments, prototype status]
