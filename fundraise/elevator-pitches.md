# Elevator Pitches — Approved Versions

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## The Final Elevator Pitch (Locked)

> "Brands have lost the direct connection to their customers in the physical world. Checkin rebuilds that connection. We empower venues with powerful **gamified loyalty** tools to build genuine community, while giving users a single, unified platform to track rewards and connect with all their favorite spots. We are launching with F&B to perfect this model before expanding into all of lifestyle commerce."

**Why this is the one:**
- **Dual-sided value:** Explicitly states benefit for both venues ("empower with gamified loyalty tools") and users ("unified platform to track rewards")
- **Problem-oriented:** Opens with the core problem ("lost connection")
- **Includes keyword:** "Gamified loyalty" front and center
- **Strategic and visionary:** Ends with expansion beyond F&B
- **Not feature-heavy:** Focused on the "why" not the "how"

## Customer-Facing Pitch — "The App Store Pitch" (Short)

> "Tired of juggling separate loyalty apps for every restaurant? Checkin is your single hub for F&B. We bring all your favorite spots together, letting you track rewards, join unique gamified programs, and climb venue leaderboards — all in one place. It's the easiest way to get treated like the regular you deserve to be."

## Customer-Facing Pitch — "The Imagine If..." Story (Long)

*Narrative format for social media, landing pages, or storytelling contexts:*

> Imagine walking into your favorite spot. You scan a QR code and the venue comes alive on your phone. You see personalized recommendations based on what you've loved before. There's a quest running: "Order for ₹5K and earn 300 venue coins." Your friend just referred someone and they both got bonus credits. You're on a 3-day streak that unlocks a discount tonight. From your table, you request a karaoke song. A live quest pops up: "Table that orders the most tequila gets a free round." And when the bill comes? You split it seamlessly — everyone's credits applied, no awkward math. That's Checkin.

## Investor Pitch — "Infrastructure" Angle

> "We're building the engagement infrastructure platform for physical-world brands. CheckIn gives every F&B venue a deep, customizable presence — their own page, quests, AI agent — powered by our platform. We aggregate venues into a shared ecosystem, but unlike Zomato/Swiggy, the venue owns every customer relationship. Revenue comes from SaaS and agentic AI usage, not food commissions. Go-to-market: dominate F&B in Bengaluru first, prove the model, then open the platform to all brands. We're not building another loyalty app — we're building the operating system for the experience economy."

**Key distinction to make if asked "aren't you an aggregator?":** CheckIn does aggregate venues — the GC economy and cross-venue discovery require a network. But the model is fundamentally different: venue owns customer data, revenue is SaaS + agentic, not per-order commission. A payment processing fee may apply if we provide gateway services — that's infrastructure cost recovery.

## Investor Pitch — "Founder's Insight" Angle

> "My career through gaming, music venues, and startups led to one observation: the physical world is still offline. We're building the platform to fix that. Checkin provides engagement infrastructure connecting users and brands in the real world, transforming transactional spaces into living communities. We prove it in the most demanding space first — F&B — then become the OS for all real-world interaction."

**Key phrase to remember:** *"The physical world is still offline."*

## Venue Pitch (For RM-Led Sales Conversations)

[TODO: Develop a concise pitch specifically for venue onboarding conversations. Should address: "How much are you paying Zomato/Swiggy?" → "What if you could own that relationship directly?" → "Here's what CheckIn gives you for ₹2,000/month"]
