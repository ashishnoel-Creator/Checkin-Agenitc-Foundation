## Outreach Strategy

1. **Warm intros are 10x more effective** — map the team's network to find connections to Tier 1 investors [TODO: Map network connections]
2. **Apply to accelerators ASAP** — Antler, YC, EF, Axilor have application deadlines; check Q1/Q2 2026 cohort dates
3. **Angel syndicate platforms** — create profiles on LetsVenture and AngelList India for visibility
4. **Bengaluru advantage** — prioritize Bengaluru-based investors (Antler, pi Ventures, Axilor, 3one4, Better Capital, Blume) for in-person meetings
5. **F&B signal** — lead with Sauce.vc and DSG Consumer Partners to establish credibility in the F&B vertical
