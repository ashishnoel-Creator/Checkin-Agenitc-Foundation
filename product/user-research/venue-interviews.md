# Venue Interview Framework & Customer Discovery

> Last synthesized: Feb 15, 2026

## Overview

**Version:** 2.0 — February 2026
**Format:** 45 questions across 10 phases, 35–45 minutes per interview
**Objective:** Validate hypotheses with quantifiable data from F&B venue owners. Get NUMBERS, not opinions. Each response should map to an investor-ready data point. Also validates GTM bundled services model (branded QR codes + marketing consultancy + branding + influencer campaigns + platform onboarding).

**Classification:** Internal document — do not share with venues.

## Interview Ground Rules

1. 30–40 minutes max. Respect their time.
2. **Push for NUMBERS.** If they say "a lot," push for a percentage or rupee amount.
3. **"I don't know" IS the data point.** Record it — that gap is the product's opportunity.
4. Do NOT pitch during Phases 0–5.
5. Phase 6: 2–3 sentences max, record FIRST reaction (not rationalized).
6. Phase 7: No reactions when they give pricing — just record.
7. Phase 9: Shut up and listen (5-second silence rule).
8. Write EXACT QUOTES for the pitch deck.
9. Score enthusiasm 1–5 (body language > words).

## Phase 0: Venue Profile (5 Questions)

Captures metadata for segmentation: venue name, location, type (Cafe/Pub/Bar/Restaurant/QSR/Fine Dining), number of outlets (Single/Chain/Franchise), operating tenure, monthly revenue range (₹2–5L / ₹5–10L / ₹10–25L / ₹25L+).

**Target filter:** Venues ₹10L+ monthly revenue in 18–30 demographic.

## Phase 1: Operational Baseline (6 Questions)

Establishes status quo with hard numbers:
- Average monthly revenue + dine-in vs. delivery split
- New vs. repeat customer ratio (**Hypothesis:** most can't answer; repeat <40%)
- Primary customer demographic by age
- Average bill value per table (ATV) with trend (**Hypothesis:** ₹800–1,500, no upsell strategy)
- First-timer vs. regular % on busy Fri/Sat
- Total monthly marketing spend (**Hypothesis:** ₹30K–1L/month, mostly untracked ROI)

## Phase 2: The Aggregator Dilemma (5 Questions)

Quantifies aggregator pain:
- % of orders via Swiggy/Zomato vs. direct (**Hypothesis:** 30–50% via aggregators)
- Effective commission rate (**Hypothesis:** 25–35%, not headline 15–20%)
- Can they access customer data from aggregators? (**Hypothesis:** 100% say No)
- Ever tried converting aggregator customers to direct? (**Hypothesis:** most tried/failed with WhatsApp inserts, QR codes)
- Potential savings if shifting 20% to direct (**Hypothesis:** ₹50K–2L/month)

## Phase 3: Tech Stack & Data (5 Questions)

Exposes fragmentation:
- POS system + satisfaction + switching intent (**Hypothesis:** Petpooja/PosBistro dominate, mixed satisfaction)
- Other tools (reservations, CRM, accounting, social) — count disconnected tools (**Hypothesis:** 3–5 disconnected, zero integration)
- Can they pull top 20 customers by visit frequency? (**Hypothesis:** <10% can)
- Do they know if a regular hasn't visited in 3 weeks? (**Hypothesis:** zero automated churn detection)
- How they collect customer feedback (**Hypothesis:** Google/Zomato primary, no structured system)

## Phase 4: Marketing & Acquisition (5 Questions)

Maps acquisition funnel:
- Top 3 channels for new customers + spend per channel (**Hypothesis:** Instagram + aggregator ads + WoM, poor tracking)
- Can they track influencer ROI? (**Hypothesis:** zero attribution)
- Can they track which offers drive repeat visits? (**Hypothesis:** no tracking, intuition-based)
- Cash discount vs. free item preference + COGS education (**Hypothesis:** most default to cash without understanding COGS — free item costs venue ~30% of face value vs. 100% for cash discount)
- Biggest challenge getting first-timers to return (open-ended)

## Phase 5: Loyalty & Retention (5 Questions)

Proves current loyalty is broken:
- Do they have a program? What does it look like? (**Hypothesis:** none, or basic stamp/points from Reelo)
- If yes: % enrolled + % actively redeeming (**Hypothesis:** enrollment <30%, active redemption <15%)
- Monthly spend on loyalty rewards (**Hypothesis:** ₹10–50K/month, zero tracked ROI)
- Ever had a customer mention the program on social or bring friends because of it? (**Hypothesis:** never — points don't generate word-of-mouth)
- Does their system recognize groups or only individuals? (**Hypothesis:** zero group-level recognition)

## Phase 6: Concept Validation (7 Features)

Score enthusiasm 1–5. Record FIRST reaction (body language > words).

1. **Leaderboard:** Live top-10 most loyal customers visible in app. (**Hypothesis:** owners see "bragging rights" appeal)
2. **Quest System:** Dynamic challenges vs. blanket discounts ("Visit 3 Fridays → free cocktail"). (**Hypothesis:** preferred over 10% off; drives specific behaviors)
3. **Community Feed:** Venue gets its own page like private Instagram. (**Hypothesis:** high interest, worried about maintenance effort)
4. **AI Agent:** Auto-detects 2-week absence, creates personalized offer, sends automatically. (**Hypothesis:** high interest, moderate trust concern — "Can I review first?")
5. **Venue Credits:** Customers earn via challenges, spend credits that cost venue ~30% (COGS) not 100% like cash. (**Hypothesis:** COGS insight = "aha moment" for most)
6. **Cross-Venue Network:** Users earn platform credits at any venue, discover your venue through the app at zero acquisition cost. (**Hypothesis:** excited to receive traffic, nervous about losing customers)
7. **Forced Ranking:** Pick ONE to start with. (**Hypothesis:** Quest or AI Agent = #1)

## Phase 7: Willingness to Pay (5 Questions)

Real commitment signals:
- Expected monthly fee for full platform (**Hypothesis:** ₹3–5K most, ₹5–10K for higher revenue)
- Preference: fixed fee vs. results-based (₹50 per repeat customer)? (**Hypothesis:** results-based preferred)
- Interest in pilot in 3 months? (**Hypothesis:** 60%+ if conversation went well)
- Referral willingness (referral = genuine excitement signal)
- ONE thing that makes this "I need this" vs. "interesting but not now"? (**Record EXACT QUOTE for deck.**)

## Phase 8: GTM Services Validation (9 Questions)

Validates pre-product GTM bundle:
- Interest in complete package (QR codes + social strategy + influencer + branding consultancy)
- Current agency/freelancer work + spend (**Hypothesis:** freelancers ₹10–25K/mo or DIY poorly)
- Would they put up branded QR codes tomorrow?
- Influencer experience — what worked, what didn't? (**Hypothesis:** tried but can't measure ROI)
- If influencer campaigns had guaranteed attribution, would they invest more? (**Hypothesis:** strong yes)
- Branding satisfaction?
- Bundle pricing (**Hypothesis:** ₹15–30K expected, ₹8–15K no-brainer)
- Service priority ranking: QR + menu / Social media / Influencer with tracking / Branding / Analytics
- Services first then platform later, or everything day one? (**Hypothesis:** "Give me something useful today")

## Phase 9: Venue Owner's Own Ideas (8 Questions)

Open-ended (5-second silence rule):
- If you could fix ONE thing about your business, what?
- Strategies to increase margins — what worked?
- What would you need to go independent from Swiggy/Zomato tomorrow?
- If you hired a consultant, what expertise and what should they do in 30 days?
- Brand you admire for customer relationships/loyalty?
- Something you've wanted to try but can't (tech doesn't exist or costs too much)?
- ₹1 lakh extra marketing budget in 30 days — how would you allocate?
- Anything I should have asked?
