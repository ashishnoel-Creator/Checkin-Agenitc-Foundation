# User & Venue Personas

> Last updated: Feb 16, 2026

## User Personas

### The Social Foodie (Primary)
- **Age:** 22–28
- **Profile:** Gen-Z, Instagram-active, values experiences over products, trusts friend recommendations over ads
- **Behavior:** Dines out 3–5x/week, often in groups, discovers venues via TikTok/Instagram and friends
- **Pain:** Juggling multiple loyalty apps, no recognition across venues, clunky bill splitting
- **CheckIn Value:** Unified app, group quests with friends, leaderboard status, seamless bill splitting

### The Venue Regular
- **Age:** 25–35
- **Profile:** Has 2–3 "home base" venues, known by staff, wants recognition and perks
- **Behavior:** Visits same venues weekly, brings friends, high lifetime value
- **Pain:** Loyalty not tracked or rewarded meaningfully, no digital status
- **CheckIn Value:** Leaderboard recognition, streak rewards, community status, exclusive access via Venue Credits

### The Group Organizer
- **Age:** 23–30
- **Profile:** The person who picks the restaurant for the friend group, coordinates plans, splits bills
- **Behavior:** Organizes 2–3 group outings/month, active on WhatsApp groups, values convenience
- **Pain:** No recognition for bringing groups (and revenue) to venues, bill splitting is manual
- **CheckIn Value:** Group quests reward the organizer, bill splitting built-in, earns credits for bringing friends

### The Explorer
- **Age:** 20–28
- **Profile:** Constantly trying new places, follows food bloggers, city-hopper
- **Behavior:** Tries 3–5 new venues/month, posts on Instagram, low loyalty to any single venue
- **Pain:** No incentive to return to places they liked, discovery is ad-driven not peer-driven
- **CheckIn Value:** GC economy rewards exploration, cross-venue discovery, personal AI suggests new spots based on taste profile

[FOUNDER INPUT NEEDED — Refine these personas with actual interview data. Do diner personas match what venues describe about their customers? Add or modify based on real patterns.]

## Venue Personas

### The Ambitious Independent
- **Type:** Single-location cafe, pub, or restaurant in Bengaluru
- **Revenue:** ₹10–25L/month
- **Staff:** 15–30 people
- **Pain:** Paying 25–35% to aggregators, zero customer data, marketing spend untracked, 3–5 disconnected tools
- **CheckIn Value:** Data ownership, gamified retention at ₹2K/month vs. aggregator commissions, unified tools
- **Likely tier:** Premium (₹2K/month)

### The Growing Chain
- **Type:** 2–5 location chain, expanding
- **Revenue:** ₹25L+/month per location
- **Pain:** Inconsistent customer experience across locations, aggregator dependency at scale, no cross-location loyalty
- **CheckIn Value:** Multi-location dashboard, cross-venue credits (Chain VCs), unified brand experience
- **Likely tier:** Enterprise

### The Instagram-First Cafe
- **Type:** Trendy, aesthetically focused, Gen-Z magnet
- **Revenue:** ₹5–15L/month
- **Pain:** High footfall but low repeat rate, customers come for the photo then never return, zero loyalty tools
- **CheckIn Value:** Quests drive return visits ("Complete the full menu quest"), leaderboard creates status, community feed replaces needing a separate Instagram strategy
- **Likely tier:** Premium (₹2K/month)

### The Established Pub/Bar
- **Type:** Well-known nightlife venue, high weekend traffic
- **Revenue:** ₹15–40L/month
- **Pain:** Empty weekdays, no way to incentivize off-peak visits, aggregator irrelevant (delivery doesn't work for bars)
- **CheckIn Value:** Time-based quests ("Tuesday Regulars Club"), karaoke/DJ plugins, group quests for parties
- **Likely tier:** Premium → Enterprise as plugins are added

[FOUNDER INPUT NEEDED — Validate and refine venue personas with interview data. Which persona is most enthusiastic about CheckIn? Which is hardest to convert? Add new personas if interview patterns reveal types not covered above.]
