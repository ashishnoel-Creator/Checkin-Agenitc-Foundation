# Product Roadmap

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## Phase 1A: The Prototype — Vision Demo (Now → Pre-Seed)

**Focus:** A vibe-coded front-end prototype demonstrating the full system end-to-end. This is not the deployed product — it's the vision made tangible. Shows investors and venues what CheckIn becomes.

**Diner Side — Browser (No App Required):**
- Check-in flow via QR — identifies the diner, auto-follows the venue
- Quest system — active quests, progress tracking, completion
- Validation systems — proof of quest completion (order-linked, visit-linked, social-linked)
- Ordering — table-side ordering with recommendations
- Reward system — VC earning and redemption
- Gated rewards — leaderboards, collectibles, premium rewards visible but locked behind app download

**Diner Side — App:**
- Discovery flow — browse venues, see what's happening, find new places via GCs
- User profile — taste profile, visit history, collections, achievements
- Feed — updates from followed venues (new quests, events, specials)
- Reward discovery, coin tracker, leaderboards, collections
- Premium memberships, streaks, gamified mechanisms
- Personal AI agent — suggests places, morning updates, quest recommendations

**Venue Side:**
- Agentic backend — venue interacts with an AI agent (via WhatsApp) for business updates, quest suggestions, live performance, customer base questions
- Analytics dashboard — unified view of customer engagement, visit patterns, quest performance, revenue impact, VC circulation
- Campaign builder — create and manage quests, promotions, events
- Feedback and complaints loop
- Plugin ecosystem showcase (karaoke, DJ, event ticketing, table reservations, menu voting)

**Ecosystem:**
- Money flow diagrams — SaaS tiers, agentic usage, payment processing, VC circulation, GC funding, brand partnerships
- Payment integration — subscription management, usage tracking

**What the prototype proves:** The full product vision is tangible. The team can build. The engagement loop makes sense. The agentic model is real. The monetization is logical.

## Phase 1B: The MVP — First Deployment (Pre-Seed → Post-Seed)

**Focus:** The focused slice deployed to real venues in Indiranagar/Koramangala to prove the model works.

**What's In:**
- QR-based browser check-in and auto-follow
- Core quest system (visit streaks, menu exploration, social referrals)
- VC earning and redemption at venue
- Basic venue dashboard with customer analytics
- Venue campaign builder (manual quest creation)
- Gated app download flow

**What's NOT In (Yet):**
- Full app with discovery, feed, personal AI agent
- GC cross-venue economy (needs venue density)
- Plugin ecosystem (needs venue feedback first)
- AI-driven autonomous quest creation (needs real data)
- Brand partnerships and premium memberships

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | What It Proves | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Quest Completion Rate | Are quests engaging enough? | >40% |
| Return Visit Rate | Are diners coming back because of CheckIn? | >35% within 30 days |
| VC Redemption Rate | Are credits valuable enough to use? | >60% |
| QR → Check-in Conversion | Does the entry flow work? | >50% of scans |
| App Download Rate | Does the gated reward model drive installs? | >20% of browser users |
| Venue Retention | Are venues staying on after trial? | >80% after 3 months |
| Venue Owner NPS | Do venues actually like this? | >50 |

**The investor pitch:** "Here's the full vision [shows prototype]. Here's what we're deploying first [shows MVP]. Here's how we know it's working [shows metrics]. Here's how we scale to the full vision [shows Phase 2]."

## Phase 2: Intelligence & Expansion (Post-Seed, 0–12 months)

**Focus:** Deploy intelligence layer and expand

**Deliverables:**
- Deploy app with discovery flow, feed, user profiles
- Per-venue AI agent learning from real customer data
- Automated quest creation tied to actual business goals (move inventory, fill slow nights)
- Personalized diner recommendations based on real taste profiles
- Global Credits launch across venue network (once venue density supports it)
- Diner-side personal AI agent goes live
- Iterate on plugin ecosystem based on venue demand
- Expand to additional Bangalore neighborhoods, validate unit economics

## Phase 3: Platform & Network Effects (12–24 months)

**Focus:** Full autonomy and network effects

**Deliverables:**
- Full agentic autonomy — venues set goals, AI handles execution
- Chain VC support for franchise operations
- Brand partnership marketplace (brands sponsor quests and GC campaigns)
- Third-party plugin marketplace
- Cross-city expansion
- Network effects compound — every new venue makes every existing venue more valuable

## Roadmap Philosophy

**Retention first → Acquisition second → Full ecosystem third.**

This credible progression differentiates from incumbents and positions CheckIn as the natural evolution of the market.
