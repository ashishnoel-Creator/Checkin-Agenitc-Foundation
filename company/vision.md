# Vision & Mission

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## Mission

Rebuild the direct connection between brands and their customers in the physical world — starting with F&B.

## Vision

Become the Operating System for the Experience Economy: the foundational platform that powers engagement, loyalty, community, and commerce for every physical venue.

## Core Beliefs

1. **The physical world is still offline.** There's no engagement layer connecting brands and customers in real-world spaces.
2. **Loyalty should be fun, not transactional.** Points are boring. Gamified experiences drive real retention.
3. **Venues should own their customer relationships.** Aggregators give venues dashboards but not individual customer identity. We give venues full profiles of every diner who's checked in.
4. **CheckIn is a platform, not white-label.** Each venue gets a deep, customizable presence within CheckIn ("Powered by CheckIn"). The venue's page feels like their space, but CheckIn is the ecosystem around it.
5. **We aggregate differently.** CheckIn does aggregate venues — the GC economy and cross-venue discovery require a network. But revenue comes from SaaS + agentic value, not per-order commissions. The venue owns the customer relationship.
6. **F&B is the proving ground, not the ceiling.** The platform extends to retail, wellness, and live events.

## Values

[TODO: Formalize team values — authenticity, speed, data-driven decisions, venue-first thinking]
