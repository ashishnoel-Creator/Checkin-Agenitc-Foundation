# Vision & Mission

> Last synthesized: Feb 16, 2026

## Mission

Rebuild the direct connection between brands and their customers in the physical world — starting with F&B.

## Vision

Become the Operating System for the Experience Economy: the foundational platform that powers engagement, loyalty, community, and commerce for every physical venue.

## Core Beliefs

1. **The physical world is still offline.** There's no engagement layer connecting brands and customers in real-world spaces.
2. **Loyalty should be fun, not transactional.** Points are boring. Gamified experiences drive real retention.
3. **Venues should own their customer relationships.** Aggregators give venues dashboards but not individual customer identity. We give venues full profiles of every diner who's checked in.
4. **CheckIn is a platform, not white-label.** Each venue gets a deep, customizable presence within CheckIn ("Powered by CheckIn"). The venue's page feels like their space, but CheckIn is the ecosystem around it.
5. **We aggregate differently.** CheckIn does aggregate venues — the GC economy and cross-venue discovery require a network. But revenue comes from SaaS + agentic value, not per-order commissions. The venue owns the customer relationship.
6. **F&B is the proving ground, not the ceiling.** The platform extends to retail, wellness, and live events.

## Values

[FOUNDER INPUT NEEDED — All three founders to align on 4–5 core values. Draft below for review:]

1. **Venue-First Thinking.** Every product decision starts with "does this make the venue's life better?" We exist to empower venues, not extract from them.
2. **Ship and Learn.** Speed over perfection. Get it in front of real venues, measure what happens, iterate. Hypotheses are only worth testing.
3. **Data Over Intuition.** We push for numbers, not opinions. Every claim in our deck, every product decision, every marketing channel — grounded in real data.
4. **Own the Relationship.** We build direct, honest relationships — with venues, with diners, with investors. No hiding behind dashboards or masked numbers.
5. **Play the Long Game.** F&B is our beachhead, not our ceiling. Every technical and strategic decision is made with the platform vision in mind.

*[Edit, add, or remove values based on what resonates with the founding team.]*
