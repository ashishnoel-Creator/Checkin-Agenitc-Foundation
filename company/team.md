### Why This Team Wins

[FOUNDER INPUT NEEDED — The team narrative for investors. Draft template below:]

The CheckIn founding team combines technical product building (Ashish), regulatory and economic design (Aravind), and growth/positioning expertise (Shash). This matters because CheckIn's success requires three things simultaneously: a technically sophisticated AI-native product, a legally compliant dual-credit economy that works under Indian regulation, and a GTM strategy that wins venue trust in a market burned by aggregator exploitation. Each founder owns one of these pillars.
