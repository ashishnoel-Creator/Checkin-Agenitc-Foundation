## Key Decisions

### F&B as Beachhead Vertical
- **Date:** Mid-2025
- **Decision:** Launch with F&B (restaurants, cafes, pubs) as primary vertical
- **Rationale:** High frequency of visits (vs. retail/wellness), strong social dynamics (group dining), acute aggregator pain (15–30% commissions), Gen-Z engagement opportunity
- **Owner:** Ashish

### Bengaluru as Launch City
- **Date:** Mid-2025
- **Decision:** Launch in Bengaluru, specifically Koramangala/Indiranagar/HSR Layout clusters
- **Rationale:** High concentration of Gen-Z, tech-savvy demographic, dense premium venue clusters, team is based here
- **Owner:** Ashish

### Dual Credit Economy (VC + GC)
- **Date:** Late 2025 / Early 2026
- **Decision:** Two-currency system instead of single reward currency
- **Rationale:** Resolves user-liquidity vs. venue-lock-in tension; provides regulatory pathway in India (VC as loyalty points, GC as platform currency)
- **Owner:** Aravind

### Freemium SaaS Before Ad Platform
- **Date:** Mid-2025
- **Decision:** Revenue Phase 1 is freemium SaaS; Ad platform is Phase 2
- **Rationale:** Need venue network density before ad platform has value; freemium drives rapid adoption
- **Owner:** Ashish

### Fixed SaaS Fee, Not Commission
- **Date:** Late 2025
- **Decision:** Charge venues fixed monthly fee, not variable commission on transactions
- **Rationale:** Venues associate variable commission with Zomato/Swiggy exploitation. Fixed fee positions CheckIn as partner, not another aggregator. Per Porter's analysis: >10% success fee = "Zomato 2.0" perception.
- **Owner:** Aravind
