## Post-Raise Runway Projection

*Derived from `fundraise/financials.md` Sections 1B and 1C.*

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Raise amount | [From financials.md] |
| Post-raise monthly burn (M1–3) | [From financials.md] |
| Post-raise monthly burn (M4–6) | [From financials.md — includes hires ramping] |
| Post-raise monthly burn (M7–12) | [From financials.md — full team] |
| Estimated revenue offset at M12 | [From financials.md P&L] |
| **Net runway post-raise** | **[Auto-calculated] months** |

**Target:** 15–18 months of runway post-raise. This gives the team enough time to hit seed-stage metrics (50+ paying venues, 10K+ MAU, demonstrated retention) before needing to raise again.
